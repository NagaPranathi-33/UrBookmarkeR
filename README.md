Challenges Faced
1. Supabase API Integration

Problem:
Connecting the frontend with Supabase and handling API responses correctly was initially challenging. I faced issues with incorrect function calls and handling asynchronous operations.

Solution:
Carefully reviewed Supabase documentation
Debugged API responses using console logs
Ensured proper async/await handling
Structured database queries properly

2. Runtime Errors (e.g., Undefined Functions)

Problem:
At one point, I encountered errors like: deleteBookmark is not defined

Solution:
Traced the function reference in the component
Ensured proper function declaration and export
Verified correct binding and usage inside event handlers

3. Meeting Requirement #4

Problem:
Requirement #4 required careful implementation and testing to ensure everything worked as expected.

Solution:
Broke the requirement into smaller tasks
Tested each part individually
Refactored the structure to keep the logic clean and scalable

What I Learnt was
Practical integration of Supabase in a real project
Managing frontend-backend data flow
Debugging runtime errors effectively
Writing cleaner and more maintainable code

Final Thoughts

This project helped me improve my understanding of full-stack integration and debugging real-world issues. I focused not only on making the application work but also on keeping the structure clean and understandable.
